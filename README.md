# ConveyorBlockMod
### Quick description
A Jump King mod containing a conveyor block, it acts like a conveyor belt gimmick (also maintaining the player's momentum when he exits it).

### Color codes
R : Always 255
G : 100 for moving right, 101 for left
B : 1 to 16 for speed (1/2 pixel per frames step)

For info, king walks at 1.5px per frames, and side jump is 3.5px.

Don't hesitate to give feedback to help improve the mod, and enjoy making awesome custom maps with the mod!

Thanks to the JK modding community for helping me during the creation of my first mod!
